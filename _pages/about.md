Since October 2025, I am a PhD student in Applied mathematics at École polytechnique, in the Inria team [ANANKE](https://team.inria.fr/ananke/) under the supervision of [Philippe Moireau](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~philippe.moireau/) and [Vincent Calvez](https://vcalvez.perso.math.cnrs.fr/). My research interests lie at the intersection of deterministic filtering, analysis on the space of measures (especially Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations), and optimal transport, and in how these concepts can be applied to models arising from biology or ecology.
